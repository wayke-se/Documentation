# DMS Integration with Wayke

## Introduction

This documentation provides insights into the integration options available for connecting Wayke with your DMS (Dealer Management System). Two primary integration paths are offered to cater to your specific needs:

- **Import Jobs:** Designed for users who work with vehicle advertisements within their DMS or external systems and wish to have their vehicles imported to Wayke.
  
- **API Integration:** Suited for those seeking a more sophisticated integration. For example where vehicles can be created in Wayke, the purchase process managed within Wayke, and once the vehicle is purchased the DMS can listen to webhook and create the vehicle in the DMS with all necessery data from Wayke.

## Import Jobs

If you need to import vehicles directly from your DMS, Wayke provides the option to transfer vehicle data via file transfer to an FTP server or if the DMS has an API of vehicles. The platform routinely scans for changes, typically every hour, to import new vehicles, remove sold vehicles, and update information related to advertisements. The following information can be imported or updated using import jobs:

- Campaign Price
- Default Price (mandatory)
- Old Price
- Leasing Price
- Manufacturer Packaging
- Mileage (mandatory)
- Model Year
- Short Description
- Registration Number (mandatory)
- Deductible VAT
- Contact Options
- Description
- Images
- Documents
- Exchange Right
- Car Warranty
- Service Plan Followed
- Equipment


## API Integration

For a more advanced and comprehensive integration between Wayke and your DMS, API integration offers a robust solution. This approach is ideal for scenarios where vehicles need to be created in Wayke, the purchasing process is managed within your DMS, and vehicles are automatically created in your DMS upon purchase. The following API endpoints are some of the available endpoints for integration:

- **Create Vehicle:** Use this API endpoint to create a vehicle listing in the Wayke platform. This is useful when you want to initiate the vehicle listing process from your DMS. The API allows you to specify all the necessary details of the vehicle. [API Documentation](https://api.wayke.se/#tag/VehicleAd/paths/https:~1~1dealer-api.wayke.se~1vehicle/post)

- **Update Vehicle:** The "Update Vehicle" API endpoint enables you to modify the details of a vehicle listing on Wayke. This is useful when there are changes or updates to the vehicle's information, pricing, or other relevant data in your DMS. [API Documentation](https://api.wayke.se/#operation/PatchVehicle)

- **Update Status:** Use the "Update Status" API endpoint to change the status of a vehicle listing on Wayke. This can be helpful when a vehicle is sold or needs to be updated with a different status based on actions within your DMS. [API Documentation](https://api.wayke.se/#operation/UpdateVehicleStatus)

- **Get Vehicle:** Retrieve information about an existing vehicle listing. [API Documentation](https://api.wayke.se/#operation/GetVehicleById)

- **Subscribe to Updates on Vehicle via Wewbhooks:** This feature allows your DMS to subscribe to updates on specific vehicles belonging to a specific branch. You will receive notifications when there are changes or updates to vehicles. This ensures that your DMS remains synchronized with Wayke's vehicle listings. Subscription is made via webhooks, and updates are sent when a vehicle is changed. See example payload below:

```json
{
  "id": "603c5053-af12-4783-b8b0-2a7589a35c07",
  "registrationNumber": "ABC123",
  "vehicleIdentificationNumber": "YV1UZBFVDN1906224",
  "status": "Unpublished"
}
```

- **Subscribe to Updates in Process Flow via Webhooks:** This feature allows your DMS to subscribe to updates in the process flow so action can be taken based on specific actions from the process flow. You will recieve notifications once a step has a new status. Below example is a notification when a contract is signed:
```json
{
  "eventType": "Process",
  "processId": "OJYlC3jyqZIV-vGmvWHFf-Vomhc",
  "processName": "Inköpsavtal",
  "stepId": "OJYlC7u19YPYu7zdKTCZroeBPiN",
  "stepName": "Inköpsavtal",
  "executedBy": "Kontrakt",
  "state": "completed",
  "eventTime": "2023-11-06T14:02:39.1427963Z",
  "itemId": "603c5053-af12-4783-b8b0-2a7589a35c07",
  "registrationNumber": "ABC123",
  "vehicleIdentificationNumber": "{vinnr}"
}
```
